# Weather

## Getting started

```sh

git checkout main

git pull origin main
```

Create a new brach.

```sh

git checkout -b ex3_server
```

Init your project.

```sh

npm init -y
```


## Instructions

You have to create a server using node.js in order to understand how a server works.

Create an app to fetch weather data for a city (lat, lon) through an API.


Receive the query


You have to create a PR in this repo when you finish.


AC:

- The API must have only one route `/weather`.
- The API must return a valid JSON.
- The app should receive the correct query params or return an error.
