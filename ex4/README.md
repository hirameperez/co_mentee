# TODO List

## Getting started

```sh

git checkout main

git pull origin main
```

Create a new brach.

```sh

git checkout -b ex4_server
```

Init your project.

```sh

npm init -y
```


## Instructions

You have to create a server using node.js in order to understand how a server works.

Create a CRUD API to manage a list of TODO's.
You'll need to design and create a database (you can use postgres or mariadb).



You have to create a PR in this repo when you finish.


AC:

- The API must be able to create a task.
- The API must return a list of taks.
- The API must be able to return a single task by id.
- The API must be able to update the state of a task.
- The API must be able to delete a single task by id.
- The API must be able to return only the unfinished tasks.
